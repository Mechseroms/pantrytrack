## PantryTrack

This is currently a passion project that I have started to learn and develop a few different things:
- Barcode Scanners and how they work
- Posgresql Databases
- SQL, JAVASCRIPT, CSS, HTML
- Database Schema management and design

PantryTrack is am inventory system that you add items to, use those items to build recipes and shopping lists.

You then can manually create receipts and or use a barcode scanner to set up a kiosk to scan in all the things you 
purchase into a receipt.

You then edit and receive that receipt into the system.

There is also the ability to use a kiosk like interface to set up a scan in and out system, where as you use things
the system will remove those items by scanning them.
